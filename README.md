# Conf language

Conf is an oriented object langage which was originally developped to allow
creation of advanced configuration files. Now, conf is developed as an
interpreted alternative of C with backward C compatibility. One aim is the
performance but without some low-level restrictions as unique name symbols
hard coded qualifiers and operators etc...

Conf langage is developed in modern C++20 for performance reasons.

Conf is a complet rewrite of [Conf-Parser](https://github.com/Kilian-Jugie/ConfParser)
